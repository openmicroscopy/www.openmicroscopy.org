title: Release of OME Files C++ 0.2.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OME Files C++ 0.2.0
---
OME Files is a reference implementation of the OME Data Model and
OME-TIFF file format for the storage and interchange of biological
imaging data and metadata. It provides support for:

-  The OME Data Model (model objects, metadatastore, XSL transforms and XML validation)
-  OME-TIFF reader
-  OME-TIFF writer

The major focus of this release was to upgrade from the old 2013-06
data model to the newly-released 2016-06 model. This brings with it
support for all of the 2015-01 model features such as map annotations,
units and quantities, plus new 2016-06 features such as support for
folders for images and ROIs, updated ROI model and updated LightSource
and Shape element hierarchies (see the [model
documentation](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/ome-model/schemas/june-2016.html)
for further information). The other major feature is the addition of
full support for Visual Studio 2015.

Major changes in this release include:

-  Added 2016-06 model support to replace the older 2013-06 model support
-  Added support for Visual Studio 2015, including binary builds
-  Improvements to the exported CMake configuration to make using the libraries easier
-  Added a BSD licence header to all components
-  The "ome-files" command wrapper now works on Windows
-  Documentation reworked to include cross-references between the manuals and API references within each component

**Downloads**

The software release is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/ome-files-cpp/0.2.0/).

This page includes links to the individual repositories and source
releases, as well as the documentation and binary builds of the
collection for several common platforms, including Windows, Linux and
MacOS X.

**Errata**

Support for building on Windows with msbuild is currently
non-functional; please use Ninja for the time being.

On Windows, "ome-files info" will display an error if run from a
directory containing a space in it. As a workaround, use "libexec
info.exe" directory.

The "ome-xml" command on Windows may not work fully on every single
Windows version due to being new and having not been tested with every
possible Windows configuration. If you encounter any problems, please
let us know and we will correct them for the 0.2.1 release.

**Support**

For any problems or comments, please use the OME [forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
