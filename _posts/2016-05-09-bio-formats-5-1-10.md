title: Release of Bio-Formats 5.1.10
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 5.1.10
---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.1.10, a bug-fix release.

This release is primarily aimed at fixing warnings being thrown by Bio-Formats for ImageJ and other non-FIJI users on Windows. These warnings have been triggered by the removal of the 3i Slidebook DLLs from the source code repository in Bio-Formats 5.1.9 and should now only be triggered when opening Slidebook files without the [update site enabled]({{ site.baseurl }}/info/slidebook).

This release also includes a couple of other bug-fixes:

* a fix in the ImageJ plugin for files grouped using the "Dimensions" option
* a fix for writing TIFF files in tiles

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.1.10/).

For any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/)
