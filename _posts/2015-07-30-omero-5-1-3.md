title: Release of OMERO 5.1.3
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.1.3
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.1.3. This is a point release that contains bug-fixes, but also adds some new functionality to OMERO.

Improvements include:

* tagging actions extended; you can now use tag sets to tag images on import
* tagging ome-tiff images at import has also been fixed
* greatly improved workflow and bug fixes for the Share functionality in OMERO.web which enables you to share images with users outside of your group (including removal of part of the UI)
* group admins and owners can now change ownership of data via the CLI
* better reporting for the 'delete' and 'chgrp' functionality in the CLI
* fixed display of images in plates with multiple acquisitions
* fixed export of results as .xls files from OMERO.insight
* improved workflow for ImageJ and OMERO interactions
* fixes for ROI display in OMERO.web (thanks to Luca Lianas of CRS4)
* fixes and workflow improvements for running scripts and script dialogs

Developer updates include:

* OMERO.web clean-up (removal of '-locked')
* reorganization of the server bundle to move various licenses and dependencies under a new 'share' folder
* refactoring of 'Chown2', 'Chmod2', 'Chgrp2' and 'Delete2'
* addition of dynamic scripts
* the 'rstring' implementation is now more lenient and should better handle unicode
* Bio-Formats submodule removed from OMERO; decoupling effort means OMERO now consumes the Bio-Formats release build from the artifactory

Sysadmin updates include:

* support for WSGI OMERO.web deployment (FastCGI will likely be deprecated in 5.1.4 and removed for 5.2)
* fixed OMERO.mail service for web errors

This release also includes the fix for the Java security issue, as discussed in the recent [blog post](https://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/2015/07/21/java-issue/). Testing suggests this fix should not have any performance implications. You should upgrade your Java version to take advantage of the security fix.

Upgrade information is on the [server upgrade page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero5.1/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html).
