title: Security release of OMERO 5.2.4
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.2.4
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.4. This is a security release to fix
the cleanse.py script used by the "bin/omero admin cleanse" command,
which was not properly respecting user permissions and may lead to
data loss.

Full details of the issue are available on the
[2016-SV1-cleanse]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2016-SV1-cleanse/)
page.

The script and command have now been made admin-only. It is highly
suggested that you upgrade your server or apply the patch available
from the security page.

This release **does not** upgrade the version of Bio-Formats which
OMERO uses, or feature any other updates.

The software is available on the [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.2.4).

Upgrade information is in the [server upgrade page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero5.2/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html).

For any problems or comments, please use the [OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/)
