title: OME Users Meeting 2017 announced
intro-blurb: The 12th Annual OME Users Meeting will be in Dundee on the 31st May and 1st June 2017
---
Currently, we aim to start on the morning of May 31 with community lightning talks followed by an afternoon of longer presentations. On June 1, we’ll have a day of workshops and discussions. We’d love feedback on last year’s UnMeeting. If you want to plan on a day of coding, maybe we can do that on June 2. If you’re interested, let us know.

For further details, see [meeting 2017]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/12th-annual-users-meeting-2017.html)

Speakers and registration information will be announced soon.

We look forward to seeing you!
