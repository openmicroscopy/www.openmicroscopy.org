title: Security release of OMERO 5.2.5
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO 5.2.5
---
Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.5. This is a security release to fix
the OMERO.shares API which was bypassing intended security
restrictions and granting elevated privileges to read
otherwise-restricted data.

Full details of the issue are available here: [2016-SV2-share]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2016-SV2-share/).

This release **does not** upgrade the version of Bio-Formats which
OMERO uses.

The software is available from [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.2.5).

Upgrade information is available in the [server upgrade page](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero5.2/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html).

For any problems or comments, please use the OME [forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).
